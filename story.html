<p>Started in 2004, Perch! is the design work of Amy Adams. Combining 
industry and craft to&nbsp; make functional yet sculptural ceramic products, 
Perch! continues to evolve.</p>
Most Perch! products are handmade right here in our little studio in 
Brooklyn New York. Amy has most likely touched every piece that goes out
 the door.<br><br>Amy Adams, the designer of all Perch! products, is from Minneapolis but 
lives in and cares deeply about Brooklyn. She has a few degrees - in Art
 (Iowa State) and Design (Pratt). She likes to make things - mostly 
ceramics but also furniture and food things too. Favorite things at the 
moment: hand painted signs, rhododendrons, storm king, block printed fabric, stools, station 
wagons, chickpeas, small boxy cabins and surf movies.<p><br></p><p><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/89aa5cb34487900710f18ca29f559223/tumblr_mihdtltjoB1rjlmhco1_400.jpg"><br></p>
