<p>We don't gift wrap but are more than happy to include a handwritten 
note - just type it in the comments field when you are checking out.</p><p>We always strive to keep our shipping materials eco-friendly and 
efficient.&nbsp; For years we have used cornstarch peanuts but are looking 
for other (lighter and less mouse friendly) alternatives. We are simply 
going to re-use a lot more of what comes in - and we hope you can re-use
 our packing materials too!</p>
<p>The most important thing for us is getting you the products safely and efficiently!</p>
